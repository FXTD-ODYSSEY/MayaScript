Tested under Maya 2011 and above, you may need to install Pymel for Maya 2010 or elder build by yourself

Known Issue:

    Please check if you run the command in Python mode, you can click "mel" word to toggle between mel and python

2.  # Error: ImportError: No module named pymel.core #
    That means you are using old version of MAYA and have no Pymel installed, please download and install Pymel follow this page:
